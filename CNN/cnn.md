**plate recognition part**


- to predict an Iranian plate number, go to predict.py , change the path string and then run it.
- If you want to train the model with train.py, you need to download data.pickle and [labels.pickle](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14zamwRhqniImDD2qtc8nhR-xP7wC-g0X/view?usp=sharing), and copy them to this folder. The download links will be provided soon.


The model has got **99.3 %** accuracy.
